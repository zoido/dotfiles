## General Code Guidelines

- All code must pass linting and tests.
  - try `make lint` and `make test` locally before committing if it fails try language specific commands.
- Follow best practices for code quality and maintainability.
- Do not add deodorant or redundant comments, use clear and self-explanatory code instead.

## PR instructions

- PR must follow conventional commit guidelines.
- Use gitmoji for commit messages.
- Always assign PR to me.
- Always create PR as draft.
- PRs should be small and focused on a single change or feature.
- Aim at PRs no longer than 300 lines of code. This is not a hard limit but a guideline to keep changes manageable.
