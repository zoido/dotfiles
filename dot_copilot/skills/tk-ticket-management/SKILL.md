# Ticket Management with tk

Use **tk** for ticket tracking. Tickets are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the directory.


## Quick Reference

```bash
tk ready              # Find available work (no blockers)
tk show <id>          # View ticket details
tk start <id>         # Claim work (set status to in_progress)
tk close <id>         # Complete work (set status to closed)
tk ls --status=open   # List all open tickets
```

## Essential Commands

### Finding Work

- `tk ready` - Show open/in-progress tickets with all dependencies resolved (sorted by priority)
- `tk show <id>` - Detailed ticket view with metadata and relationships
- `tk start <id>` - Set status to in_progress (claim work)
- `tk ls` - List all tickets
- `tk ls --status=open` - All open tickets
- `tk ls --status=in_progress` - Your active work
- `tk ls --status=closed` - Recently closed tickets
- `tk blocked` - Show open/in-progress tickets with unresolved dependencies
- `tk dep tree <id>` - Show dependency tree (deduplicates by default)
- `tk dep tree --full <id>` - Show full tree (all occurrences, no deduplication)

### Creating & Updating

- `tk new "Ticket title"` - Create a new ticket (defaults to status: open, type: task, priority: 2)
  - `--type=bug|feature|task|epic|chore` - Ticket type
  - `-p, --priority 0-4` - Priority (0=critical, 2=medium, 4=backlog)
  - `-d, --description "..."` - Description text
  - `-a, --assignee username` - Assign to someone
  - `--parent <id>` - Parent ticket ID
  - `--acceptance "..."` - Acceptance criteria
  - `--design "..."` - Design notes
  - `--external-ref "..."` - External reference (e.g., gh-123)
- `tk close <id>` - Set status to closed (mark complete)
- `tk reopen <id>` - Set status to open
- `tk note <id> "..."` - Append timestamped note to ticket
- `tk dep <id> <dependency-id>` - Add dependency (first ticket depends on second)
- `tk undep <id> <dependency-id>` - Remove dependency
- `tk link <id> <id> [id...]` - Create symmetric link between tickets (bidirectional)

### Querying & Filtering
- `tk query` - Output all tickets as JSON, one per line
- `tk query '.priority == "0"'` - Query with jq-style filters
- `tk query '.status == "open"'` - Find open tickets
- `tk query '.type == "bug"'` - Find bugs

### Maintenance
- `tk prune` - Dry-run: show dangling references (refs to deleted tickets)
- `tk prune --fix` - Actually remove dangling references from deps, links, and parent fields
  - Use case: After manually deleting ticket files (e.g., `rm .tickets/x-abc1.md`)
  - Ensures store consistency by cleaning up orphaned references

## Common Workflows

### Starting work:
```bash
tk ready              # Find available work
tk show <id>          # Review ticket details
tk start <id>         # Claim it
```

### Completing work:
```bash
tk close <id>         # Mark complete (can provide full or partial ID)
```

### Creating dependent tickets:
```bash
tk new "Implement feature X" --type=feature
tk new "Write tests for X" --type=task --parent=<feature-id>
tk dep <test-id> <feature-id>  # Tests depend on Feature (Feature blocks tests)
```

### Working with blocked tickets:
```bash
tk blocked            # See what's blocking progress
tk show <id>          # View dependencies preventing work
tk close <blocker-id> # Close the blocking ticket
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL 🚨

- When working on worktree or as background agent tickets are not transferred to the worktree or agent context. Make sure to use `tk` from the main workspace context to manage tickets, and not from within a worktree or agent session, to ensure ticket state is properly maintained and visible across contexts.
- **File issues for remaining work** - Create tickets with `tk new` for anything that needs follow-up
  - Create tickets for tracking strategic and/or discovered work (multi-session, dependencies, discovered work)
- **Update ticket status** - Close finished work with `tk close <id>`
  - Work is NOT complete until tickets are properly closed
  - NEVER leave work in ambiguous state (e.g., started but unclear if done)
  - Ticket state is the source of truth for project progress
